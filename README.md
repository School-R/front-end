### Background of Project by Kara Peoples
This project was my brain child. During the start of the Covid-19 Pandemic in 2019-2020 we were given a break from school. This project was a team collaboration in which we prepared to make up time for missing a Project at Lambda School. I thought of the parents that must immediatly become teachers and what way could an app improve their lives immediatly. I also though once things went back to "normal" or at least as normal as can be some parents would still choose to Home School. Shcool'R answers this problem by providing a social media platform for both parent and child to find projects to aid in learning through a community of like minded individuals. It would also be great to aid in extra learning for extra-credit or extra-curricular activity projects. So please enjoy!!
